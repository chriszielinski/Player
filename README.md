## Installation
`Player` is available for installation using the Cocoa dependency manager CocoaPods & Carthage.  Alternatively, you can simply copy the `Player.swift` file into your Xcode project.

### Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)

```ruby
pod "Player"
```

Need Swift 3? Use release `0.7.0`

```ruby
pod "Player", "~> 0.7.0"
```

### Using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

```ruby
github "piemonte/Player"
```

## Quick Start

The sample projects provide an example of how to integrate `Player`, otherwise you can follow these steps.

Create and add the `Player` to your view controller.

```swift
 let player = Player()
 player.playerDelegate = self
 player.playbackDelegate = self
 player.view.frame = view.bounds
 player.add(to: self)
```

Provide the file path to the resource you would like to play locally or stream. Ensure you're including the file extension.

```swift
let videoUrl: URL = // file or http url
player.url = videoUrl
```

play/pause/chill

```swift
player.playFromBeginning()
```

Adjust the fill mode for the video, if needed.

```swift
 player.fillMode = .resizeAspectFit
```

The fill mode can be set to the following values:

`.resizeAspectFit` (default)
![Player](readme-assets/aspectFit.png)

`.resizeAspectFill`
![Player](readme-assets/aspectFill.png)

`.resizeStretch` (aka please don't. I mean look at the poor thing)
![Player](readme-assets/stretch.png)

Display video playback progress, if desired. Note, all delegate methods are optional.

```swift
extension ViewController: PlayerPlaybackDelegate {

	public func playerPlaybackWillStartFromBeginning(player: Player) {}
    
    public func playerPlaybackDidEnd(player: Player) {}
    
    public func playerCurrentTimeDidChange(player: Player) {
        let currentProgress = Float(player.currentTime / player.maximumDuration)
        progressView.setProgress(currentProgress, animated: true)
    }
    
    public func playerPlaybackWillLoop(player: Player) {
        progressView.setProgress(0.0, animated: false)
    }
    
}
```

### macOS
On the macOS platform, the player can display media controls. 

```swift
player.controlsStyle = .floating
```

The controls' style can be set to the following:

`.none`

`.inline` (default)
![Player](readme-assets/inline.png)

`.minimal`
![Player](readme-assets/minimal.png)

`.floating`
![Player](readme-assets/floating.png)
